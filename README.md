# Prediction of Future location using Hidden Markov Model 
The aim was to predict the user's future location using the past data. As if we can predict the location of any particular user so we can recommend him about the real time situation of the predicted location. We used Geolife data set having the location of 180 users with date and some other features. So initially we clustered the near by locations then Hidden Markov Model was used to fit the data and predict the most probable future location of a particular user.
